<h1 align="center">Down2Earth Training workshop on Python programming for ICPAC staff</h1>
<h2 align="center">29<sup>th</sup> May – 2<sup>nd</sup> June 2023, Naivasha, Kenya</h2>

## Goal:
The main goal of the training is to improve the capacity of ICPAC staff in the use and
applications of Python programming for hydrological and climate forecast modeling.

## Outputs/Outcomes:
* Understanding basic Python concepts and libraries (netCDF manipulation files,
* xarray, pandas, rasters, numpy, and shell scripting,
* Implement file handling and exception handling techniques
* Understand operators, sets, methods, and dictionaries in-depth
* Run commands by implementing conditional statements, loops, and functions
* Basic understanding of python skills required for the use and applications of CUWALID and in hydrological forecast and climate models.

## Workshop plan and tasks of the day
* Day 1- Introduction to data analysis pandas
* Day 2- Harness the power of for loop!
    Brainstorming points and code snippets related to the task of day:
       1. Difference of vector and raster
       2. Using vector to subset raster
       3. Summarizing the raster into data frame
       4. Climate science data format, CPT, netcdf, zarr
       5. Using the cloud objects from zarr rather than full download
       6. CF convention/metadata standards
* Day 3- Befriend with Dataarray and Dataframe!
     Brainstorming points and code snippets related to the task of day:
       1. Introduction to pandas dataframe and xarray data array
       2. Dataframe into raster and map plotting
       3. Formula computation on dataframe, climada source code read
       4. Algorithm apply on dataframe column, the powerplay with apply and lamda methods
* Day 4- Hello to CPT from python!
     Brainstorming points and code snippets related to the task of day
       1. Reading CPT file in python, simple text file read in python
       2. Introduction to regex and reading specific headings of CPT
       3. Plotting the CPT, introduction to matplotlib and cartopy
       4. Subplot- multi panel mapping/ plotting, animating the maps
       5. Mapping template for GHACOF country presentation and way forward to use Python in coproduction workshop
* day 5- Exploration into reproducible research recreating the plots from published studies. Suggested studies
